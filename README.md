## My process
Hi everyone I'll elaborate the steps I took towards completing my project in this paragraph.
I commenced with the creation of the html page using the startup file that came along with the project, then I embedded the style into the html page. From then on I placed the tags for each element I was making use of, starting with the div with class "container" which houses the img, h3 and p respectively. Aligning my elements in this format enabled the sequential order with which they appear on the web page, so aligning your elements according to how you want them to appear is necessary, although the styling can play an effect with the alignment, but to be on a safer side I chose this format. You'll also see added therein is my image link which enables the of the image which I had to style to fit it in accurately into the container.
Finally the second <div> contains the attribution class, which was added to the original startup file so I had to modify it to suit my preference.
I guess that's regarding the steps I took. Please feel free to comment you observations and I'd be honored to hear your inputs.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Google fonts (https://fonts.googleapis.com)


### What I learned

 I learnt a great deal while working on this project it wasn't all that challenging but I got to try out things that were fascinating. Like some css features....
 ```css
 body{
   font-family: 'Outfit' serif;
 }
 ```
 The above involved using an external font, which isn't in my system.
 In the html I pretty much understood the usage of the elements I used, so there wasn't anything new there.

### Continued development
I'd like to work more on my positioning of elements, I kind of have a flaw there since positions are quite tricky for me at times.
You'd notice I used the margin property when aligning elements, I learnt that it helps in granting responses for block element that are too stubborn(ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…) to move with item align or text align.
Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://fonts.googleapis.com) - I'm very sure this resource is well known, it helps you choose whatever fonts you'd like to add to your webpage. It really does come in handy.
